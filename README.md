# tinode_flutter_chat

A drop-in Flutter chat UI for the [Tinode](https://github.com/tinode/chat) chat server, built on
[`tinode_dart_client`](../tinode_dart_client).

## Features

- Connects, logs in with a built-in form or with credentials you pass, and keeps the session for as
  long as the widget lives.
- Shows the chat list from `me`, newest first, with unread counts that follow new messages and reads
  from other devices.
- Opens direct chats, groups and channels. Channel followers get a read-only view.
- Loads history, pages older messages in on scroll, and merges live messages as they arrive.
- Sends plain text and marks what the user sees as read.
- Restyle it with a `TinodeChatTheme` theme extension, and translate or reword it with
  `TinodeChatStrings`.
- Needs no `ProviderScope` or other setup in your app.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:tinode_flutter_chat/tinode_flutter_chat.dart';

void main() => runApp(
  MaterialApp(
    home: TinodeChat(
      config: TinodeConfig(
        server: Uri.parse('wss://chat.example.com'),
        apiKey: '<your API key>',
        userAgent: 'MyApp/1.0',
      ),
      // Optional: skip the login form. Keep the token from onLoggedIn.
      // credentials: TinodeCredentials.token(savedToken),
      onLoggedIn: (login) => saveToken(login.token),
    ),
  ),
);
```

To restyle the chat, add a theme extension:

```dart
ThemeData(
  extensions: [
    TinodeChatTheme.fallback(ThemeData()).copyWith(ownBubbleColor: Colors.teal),
  ],
)
```

See [`example/`](example/lib/main.dart) for a runnable app. To try it locally, start the server
from `../tinode-tests` (`docker compose up -d`) and log in as `alice` / `alice123`.

## Current limits

This release covers the online happy path. Not built yet:

- offline cache and message search (waiting on the client);
- typing indicators, read receipts per message, sender names in groups;
- attachments, rich Drafty rendering (messages show their plain text);
- creating chats, finding users (`fnd`).

## Development

Start with [`docs/`](docs/README.md): architecture, Riverpod usage, widget rules and testing.
